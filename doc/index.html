    Erlang Patterns of Concurrency (epocxy)
  </head>
  <body>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This library provides common architectural patterns that have proven
      useful in building high volume, low latency, reliable erlang
      applications. In general, these patterns leverage controlled process
      spawning and data contexts built on top of Erlang Term Storage (ets)
      tables. Ets is the only truly concurrent construct in erlang because
      it includes row-level locks in the VM's C implementation. Multiple
      processes running on a multi-core CPU may access separate rows of
      an ets table simultaneously, providing a speed up that other erlang
      constructs cannot.

      <di><a href="ets_sup.html">Ets Supervisor</a></di>
      <dt>
        An ets supervisor can be included directly into your own
        supervisor hierarchy to allow the generation of ets tables
        that are owned and managed by a process which is guaranteed
        to live longer than any workers which need access to the ets
        tables.

    <dd>
      <di><a href="ets_buffers.html">Ets Buffers</a></di>
      <dt>
        An ets buffer is a stack, queue or ring implemented using an
        ets table with array indexing semantics as its key. Ring buffers
        handle fast concurrency without expanding memory use, FIFO
        buffers emulate a queue, and LIFO buffers emulate a stack.
        The intent is to allow concurrent access to a set of data,
        but that means that the order of processing will not exactly
        match serial implementations of these data structures.

    <dd>
      <di><a href="generational_cache.html">Generational Cache</a></di>
      <dt>
        A generational cache eschews individual datum eviction timers
        by expiring an entire cache of items in one atomic action.
        Expiration can be governed by number of accesses to the cache,
        amount of time since cache was created or a user-supplied
        arbitrary function. Cached items are maintained in a new and
        an old generation (an ets table for each in this implementation),
        where items only arrive in the new generation by migrating
        forward from the old or by being requested for the first time.
        A generation ages once and is replaced with an empty generation
        before being eliminated completely.
      </dt>
    </dd>

    <dd>
      <di><a href="cxy_fount.html">Concurrency Fount</a></di>
      <dt>
        A concurrency fount provides an apparently unlimited source
        of pre-spawned processes which may be OTP-compliant gen_*
        servers or bare processes. The interface supports obtaining
        the next available Pid, optionally sending a message to it
        before returning the reference. The fount is actually slab
        allocated and provides a ceiling with indication of exhaustion
        when the rate at which processes are used exceeds the ability
        to replace them.
      </dt>
    </dd>

    <dd>
      <di><a href="cxy_ctl.html">Concurrency Control</a></di>
      <dt>
        Concurrency control establishes configurable limits on the
        number of concurrently executing processes per category of
        worker task, reducing the likelihood of exceeding a servers
        capacity. When a limit is reached, the code may be configured
        to run the task inline or to refuse to execute.
      </dt>
    </dd>

    <dd>
      <di><a href="cxy_synch.html">Synchronization Barriers</a></di>
      <dt>
        A synchronization barrier is a generalized pattern for coordinating
        the activity of multiple concurrent processes. It allows for
        gating process execution until all are ready to start, collecting
        results but only returning when all or a quorum are complete or
        agree, ordering a chain of backgrounded steps, or other styles of
        cooperative processing which allow more efficient use of multiple
        cores.
