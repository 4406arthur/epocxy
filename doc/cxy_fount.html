    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A concurrency fount is a continuous supply of pre-spawned processes
      which is restricted by the speed in which the processor can spawn
      fresh replacements versus the pace at which waiting processes are
      consumed. Running out of processes is a temporary condition, but
      is signalled in the return value so that the requester may apply
      some form of back-pressure or queueing to reduce the spike of
      consumption until more resources are available.
    </p>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      Processes serve a multitude of purposes including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Encapsulating a transaction</li>
      <li>Backgrounding slow tasks to improve responsiveness</li>
      <li>Firewalling potential faults from other components</li>
      <li>Providing an asynchronous or synchronous service</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A concurrency fount can be used when processes may be needed
      quickly or in a system where demand expands and contracts.
      The fount attempts to amortize the cost in CPU and memory
      pressure so that spikes in demand do not compound heavy
      server load. Because used processes are replaced as quickly
      as possible, there will still be pressure on the server, but
      at least while demand first spikes, the necessary resources are
      already available. Sustained demand will outstrip the supply of
      pre-spawned processes.
    </p>
    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <p>
      A cxy_fount is an instance of a gen_fsm with slab allocated
      layers of processes. The top layer is the <em>fount</em> and
      the lower layers are the <em>reservoir</em>. On initialization,
      the caller specifies the maximum count of processes in a slab,
      and the depth of the reservoir including the fount. When a slab
      of processes is spawned, it happens inside a separate newly
      spawned process to isolate the action and allow bulk delivery
      of a slab in a single message, and to allow all slabs to be
      allocated in parallel. All spawned slab members are linked to
      the cxy_fount gen_fsm so that they will be destroyed if the
      gen_fsm is killed by its supervisor.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a process is needed, it is fetched from the front of the
      fount, optionally sent a message, and unlinked from the cxy_fount
      instance. The unlinking happens because the caller is expected
      to manage the life cycle and monitoring of the process once it
      is tasked with computation. The cxy_fount is only responsible
      for cleaning up spawned processes while they are still idle.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a process is requested after the internal fount is exhausted,
      the top layer of the reservoir is moved to the fount, the first
      item is fetched, and a new process is spawn_linked to generate a
      replacement slab. The reservoir is maintained as a push-down
      stack for efficiency with the oldest spawned processes submerged
      at the bottom of the reservoir.
    </p>
    <p>
      A behaviour is provided by the implementer when using a cxy_fount
      in an application. The behaviour specifies what type of process
      is used, typically differentiating between an OTP-compliant process
      versus a bare process. If an OTP-compliant process is desired,
      servers which are idle in the fount for a long enough period may
      be hibernated to save memory. This is a feature that must be
      thoroughly tested in your own environment because when the demand
      spikes, stale processes will have to come out of hibernation and
      that imposes two full garbage collections which may add to the
      CPU pressure depending on the complexity of the internal state.
